# Intro to Obsidian

The best resource for beginnign with Obsidian is https://help.obsidian.md/. That said, the Obsidian note-taking application, offered by https://obsidian.md/ as a Windows, OSX, Linux, and mobile iPhone and Android app[^1]. There are many other things named "Obsidian", including an amazing game production company. To separate Obsidian from other same-named things when doing a web search, I write "Obsidian.md" (e.g. "[obsidian.md best practices](https://www.google.com/search?q=obsidian.md+best+practices)").

## Purpose

Obsidian.md is built from the ground up with you in mind. It is "A second brain, for you, forever." What that means is that the files used by Obsidian are human-readable. You handle where and how those files are stored. You can use other Markdown tools against the files. You can even take the entire vault folder and files to another application and never touch Obsidian.md again, if you wanted to. The key to Obsidian is that what you make is yours and yours alone. You don't need a special export/import process to be able to use your files elsewhere.

So the purpose of Obsidian is what you make it, but it's designed around end-user freedom.

## Features

## Learning Markdown

For the most part, one may use Obsidian.md without knowing the Markdown language. The language itself is a way to typeset, footnote, title, and section documents quickly and easily without a word processor. Obsidian.md supports all the typical keyboard shortcuts for editing text (like copy-and-paste, **bold**, *italics*, etc.).
