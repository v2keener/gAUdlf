Here are some of the things to do with this project. All of them are housekeeping tasks for knowledge management and information retention, or whatever one's purpose with this software.

## TODO

- Yay `vim` commands! I need Daily Note, select plugins (list + steps for install, purpose, etc.)
- Open Obsidian every day `<-- I wrote this after writing the sub-bullets`
	- For this example, more content is probably more, so I'll do my best to err on opening this #app/Obsidian/vault every day, going forward. 
		- Days to presentation are counting down. The next 168 hours will be different. 
- Theme and overlay stuff should be irrelevant. 
	- 2ba-footnote: (Overlay stuff, if not yet shared, is a set of #lang/CSS "snippets" I use to make things look as I wish on many themes (not all; I shy from the `!important` ...uh... thing; the best practice is to lean on specificity; with that in mind, Blue Topaz theme is beautiful and it supports the Style Settings #app/Obsidian/plugin, which is lovely&mdash;really something special for someone who enjoys tinkering). So the Overlay stuff is for fun. I pick something I want to know about and fiddle with it, then I get bored quickly because, heh, #personal/health/ADHD
- My idea is don't be too strict with this kind of thing. Working at it, one should form a bit of an ecosystem naturally. 
- Session: I'll need to try using traditional shortcuts more often, perhaps try one of the plugins that makes the Editor practically 100% #tech/WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
- git: Maybe that should be topmost...
- Linter - because clean #lang/Markdown is happy Markdown.
