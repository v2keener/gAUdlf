# 2022-06-22 Wed

Yesterday, I added an `.obsidian-iphone` folder, which I checked in and pushed to github.com this morning. I did this after enabling the ability to edit this project on my iPhone by using Work Copy for git functionality and to link vault folders into the Obsidian folder on my phone. Instead of doing that, I would recommend using Obsidian.md's Sync. 

Much of what I do involves doing a thing to see if I can. Typically, I will lay down my material and *then* organize.

For this project, things are getting WAY down to the wire, so I want the things I've set in sponge to be set in stone. The best way I have to do that is to use the Reminder plugin and [[Presentation Project Tasks]]. For now, all I have is an example reminder to test things. 

## Updates to Reminder plugin settings

For Reminders, I:
- Switched to "Tasks plugin format" 
	- this is because I like emojis
- Disabled "Enable Reminder plugin format"
- Enabled "Enable Tasks plugin format"
- Enabled "Distinguish between reminder date and due date" 
	- this is because I like being able to have a due date, though I have yet to use it - I wouldn't encourage having features you don't use enabled, but I make an exception for myself here, and you should make all the exceptions you need for yourself, too
- Detection time and Reminder Check interval are now "300", which is 5 minutes
	- the goal with 5 minutes is to keep Reminder from interrupting me more than every 5 minutes (maximum). So if I have 10 reminders with some at 10:01, some at 10:02, and some at 10:03, instead of seeing all of them at those exact minutes, I will see them at 10:05 (probably). I don't use reminders for things that are timely. For that, I use Calendar (a calendar app - in my case Outlook Calendar).
