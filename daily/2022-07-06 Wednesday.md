There's still lots more to do and just a pinch over 168 hours until my presentation.

Watching some presentations on Obsidian has helped me calm myself down in terms of thinking "I'm under-prepared! The sky is falling!" 

Even flying by the seat of my pants with an outline and this demo vault, things should be just fine. 

For the presentation, I'll have an hour. The first minute or two will be me introducing myself, maybe setting expectations for the presentation, and then I should achieve 30 to 40 minutes of content, and then have 10 to 15 minutes of Q&A until a few minutes before the next session starts.

Much later...

It turns out my brain is fun. I thought the conference was next week. Sometimes, I *do this **to** myself* by making a timeline more "present" in my mind. This is a type of #personal/health/ADHD hack, but in this case, it was entirely unintentional and I feel like my brain is gaslighting me (but it's a "haha 😁" feeling, not a "haha 😫" feeling). 

I also think of the fact that I have different plugins between this and my personal and the `.obsidian` folder for my iPhone. I don't have 100% solid recommendations there: just what works for me. The same could be said of this entire presentation. It's very exciting.
