# 20220507 Saturday

[[2022 05 06 Friday|Yesterday]]
[[2022 05 09 Monday|Next day of notes]]

Today, I'm going to do some of the things I wrote about [[2022 05 06 Friday|yesterday]].

I wrote a [[#Plugins document|doc]], included as an embed, below. It's a simple list with a few footnotes, presently.

Next, I'll be [[#AU Plugins Setup|setting up plugins]]. As much as I can, I'll document "why" or "to what end", but I want to be done in about 15 to 20 minutes.

The last thing for now is to include the `.obsidian/workspace` file for this vault. Another thing I want to do is to make it so all those plugins are git submodules, but I'm not rushing on that one. It's a #edit/sidequest.

## Looking at Plugins

Observing from the #app/Obsidian/vault I use every day...

- List of Current Core Plugins
	- #2ba-footnote This was not as easy as I wished. I'm using #app/MS-Notepad (Microsoft `notepad.exe`) as my text editor just to put stuff down while I look between vaults.

## Plugins document

## AU Plugins Setup

#edit Doing this via #app/VSCode for looking at [[Obsidian Default Core Plugins]] while working on [[AU Plugins]], which I'd forgotten I made until I hit the double-open square-bracket (i.e., `[[`, a.k.a. SHIFT+squiggle bracket, which is `{`) for Obsidian to allow me to find a file within this #personal/vault.
