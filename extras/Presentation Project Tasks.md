# Presentation Project Tasks

- [x] Bring over the Templater templates I use in my usual vault to make these reminders simpler 
- [x] First item to do (example) ⏰ 2022-06-22 17:29 📅 2022-06-23 ✅ 2022-06-23
- [x] Add three Favorites to demonstrate for the left action pane ⏰ 2022-06-29 11:55 📅 2022-06-23
	- OK. I'm delayed on this one. I'm running a special organizational subroutine for exceptional circumstances, which is to say that: If I'm under the wire, if the deadline is here or past, I cut my losses and work with what I have. What I have will be enough if it's all prepared, and in the personal vault, I have pretty much 10 minutes of content prepared (unless I wanted to make it *mostly* guided participation). All that said to excuse the fact that I'm marking this item "done" even though I don't have "three Favorites". The other two favorites can be class participation (I presume to have a class).
- [x] Bring over latest template work from personal vault ⏰ 2022-07-07 📅 2022-06-29 ✅ 2022-07-07
	- This task I'll keep.
- [x] Pick a vault: For presentation outline, task work, use personal vault (copy-and-paste) ⏰ 2022-06-29 09:56 📅 2022-06-29 [^1] ^9bcf9f
	- I've more or less done this... 🙂	
	- Fun fact: I did do this task, but now I have more to the task. Specifically, the collaboration between this project and my daily notes gave me some new ideas which I do wish to pull over from my work vault, but also what I have here is functional and fine. Its intent is simplicity, so that's accomplished. I'm marking this task done today (20220706).
[^1]:  An alternative might be to do file hardlinks on the backend I use to run my personal vault, but "superfluous" and "procrastination" are words that come to mind with that idea.
