Over the weekend, I thought a lot about note-taking. Specifcally, I thought about the two driving questions that I have, "Where do I begin?" and "What do I need to remember?"

There isn't an easy, general answer for where to begin. That really comes down to personal preference. It's best to start small. Even better is to build the conventions of one's notes&mdash;"this goes here, that goes there"&mdash;as one is note-taking. 

So I recommend against beginning with a system of organization in mind. If you know something like Zettelkasten and like it, use it. Chances are good that if I have a suggestion which doesn't seem useful to you, it probably won't be useful to you. Typically, there's no point in trying to get something to fit where it doesn't or shouldn't fit. ^fc0300

Intuition should be the guiding "inner voice" or hunch telling you what might be most useful to you. 

Typically, the kinds of notes I'm describing become worthy of knowledge base or wiki or other published content. With that in mind, you should only make documents and take notes you wish to review and maintain. 

You could also take notes for the short term, in which case how you use Obsidian should be rather different than how I use it. I prefer to keep everything in one vault (aside from this project content).

### Where I began

Since I'm a knowledge worker who needs to remember what I've done during my workday, I began with Daily Notes at the beginning of 2021, when I switched from OneNote to Obsidian[^1]. Those daily notes have grown into my own personal library.

My daily notes are organized by the week, which each week of the year getting its own folder. The folder organization doesn't seem to be that important in terms of how I use Obsidian, but I prefer not to have one Daily Notes folder with hundreds of daily notes. The same applies for organizing other documents into folders: It's purely for my own convenience.

If you're a student, your needs will be different than an instructor, just as an instructor or students' needs might be different from mine. Tracking course-related notes and materials, could mean a different note-taking toolset to achieve the best results in Obsidian.

For my purposes, these kinds of notes work. As you can see below, I tend to write a lot:

### My methodology

To annotate my notes in the hopes of making them more useful, I use tags (`#something`) mostly to refer to things. For instance, I use #app/Obsidian to refer to Obsidian itself in a document.

Each person I work with gets their own document. It's nicer than Outlook because it's mine and I'm only making notes that might be useful to me later. 

Rarely do I compare documents, but Sliding Panes can be helpful (sometimes). Typically I simply open a doc in a new pane beside the document or notes I'm editing/updating.

For small courses I take, I typically have one document per course. A good example would be 20-minute modules from OpenSesame. For larger courses, or courses where I'm expected to attend multiple times a week, I would probably create a Home document, then organize links to my course related notes there. I would also probably keep all those documents in a folder like `study/Physics`, for instance. The best approach to document, folder, and home (index / TOC / "See Also") document creation is to consider "Will it be difficult to find this later?" 

[^1]: Incidentally, going from OneNote to Obsidian was not easy. I forget *how many steps I took*, but it was a lot, it involved translating my notes into Word documents, and then using Pandoc (CLI app) to convert those to Markdown.
