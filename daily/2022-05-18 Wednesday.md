For these notes, I'm taking them in my personal vault first. 

## On Reference Apps - Progressive Web Applications

A category of applications that come in handy almost every day can be created individual to you. 

Specifically, if I use a web site as reference more or less daily (or at least a few times a month, say), I "install" that site as an Edge or Chromium "App". 

In Edge, you may click an ellipsis (...), click "Apps", and then click "Install this site as an app...". You should read the prompts that follow and answer your hearts desire and/or google unknown stuff (if needed). 

Apps installed from Edge or Chrome are called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) by Microsoft. Chrome has them as links, which operate very similarly.

My examples of what I use daily are:

- An App for Work Orders - An internal ticketing system is its own web app
- An App for Third-Party Customer Support Site - An external ticketing and documentation system for a software I support.
- An App for the AppWiki - An internal reference system to formalize technical documentation wiki-style.

Also, I have Edge as my default web app (so links open there), Edge Beta as the default for creating my PWAs (which is also where a PWA will open links if I hold the CTRL key while clicking the link). Then I have Chrome installed for sites that require it. Last, and perhaps most importantly, Mozilla Firefox is my "extention free" operational browser. It's my preferred browser server admin pages and for the third-party softwares where I'm able to offer help.
