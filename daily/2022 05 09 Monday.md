My commitment to myself is to write every day here until I get this project up and running. The purpose of the project is to show *how I* set up an Obsidian vault for note-taking. Since these daily notes are meant to be a [[Daily Note]].

To set up the Daily Note plugin, first I enabled under Core Plugins in Settings, then I clicked the (new) Daily Note settings to set the folder for these kinds of notes to be `daily` at the root of this vault.

Another useful setting is "Open daily note on startup", which I often have done. 

There's a lot more to plug it all in as a Golden ecosystem, but this is a good start.
