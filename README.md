# Obsidian AU Vault

(THIS IS DRAFT MATERIAL - the Conference is in mid July 2022, so I'm preparing this "live")

This vault is intended as a public Github repo for for content related to the West Virginia State Technology Conference 2022 presentation on "Note-taking in Obsidian"[^1].

"gAUdlf" means:
- 'g' for "Gustavo"
- 'AU' as the elemental symbol for "gold"
- 'dlf' for my last name, "DeLaFuerza", which is Spanish for 'of the force'

## A Golden Vault

This Github repository is intended as a "golden" Obsidian vault. One can use this or the 'template' version of this vault to have some pre-made things I find handy in my primary, private vault for note-taking.

For instance, I've chosen some plugins I find handy to incorporate as submodules. I've also included the `.obsidian` folder, which has the `*.json` files, CSS, and other support files.



[^1]: "Note-taking in Obsidian" was presented on behalf of West Virginia Network (WVNET), the company that hosted the conference. Gustavo Keener, a Banner DBA for WVNET, is the author of this content.
