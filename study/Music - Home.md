## On Home Pages

As with the "Home" pages, generally, this Home page offers more structure with some redundancy. In the same way that each doc is in a folder on my laptop, each Home page kind of duplicates what's in the folders *as presently constituted*. The Home pages are the organic part of currating useful things I've written or stored.
