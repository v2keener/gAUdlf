"...And, we're back." &mdash; Rifftrax

So far in these notes, I see dailies, which are great for me. Then there's extras, sidecars, study, and zettel. "sidecars" is one folder too many. I'll modify that, keeping what works. "extras" already covers my "[[Getting Things Done|place to hold things until I can think of a place for them]]". 

The study/obsidian folder should get some focus today.

"zettel" folder can probably be removed. If I don't use it, I won't be able or care to explain anything about it. If you like it, it's a great system. The plugin can timestamp files, and has other features in Obsidian's Settings.

I don't understand I made [[AU Plugins]], but it needs better editing.

I moved the `testing` folder to `z ðŸŽ² testing` because I like emojis, and prefixing it (in front) with a 'z' puts it at the bottom of the folders list at the root of the vault.

Next time I visit this, I want to do more editing of stuff that's already here, then I'll move forward with preparing to present.
