For the [West Virginia State Technology Conference (2022)](https://wvstc.com/) on Tuesday, July 19, 2022 at The Morgantown Event Center at Morgantown Marriott, Waterfront Place in Morgantown, WV (See also: the [Conference Overview](https://wvstc.com/conference-overview/) and [Attendee FAQ](https://wvstc.com/attendee-faqs/)) at 1 PM, I'll be presenting on "[Note-Taking in Obsidian]([Note-taking in Obsidian - WVSTC](https://wvstc.com/conference-sessions/note-taking-in-obsidian/))". WVNET posted it just under two weeks ago.

There was so much more I was going to write, but didn't get to it. The day remained rather busy and I was distracted with a minor but acute health issue.
