For these notes, I'm taking them in my personal vault first. Also, this project/vault is in my second virtual desktop (Windows 10).

A cool thing about how this vault/project is presently set up is that I do an update, leave it for Obsidian Git to put my update in source control. The disadvantage to that is the lack of comments with #app/Git, but I don't mind that for document editing, anyway. 

Note-taking with Obsidian is deeper than word-processing in many ways. The links between documents and references within references can make that very clear, especially once one become comfortable working with "blocks" (Obsidian Help will be the best resource on that topic). 

- It took a little while to get the ticketing custom app up and running because I needed to organize and then look up a few things (see [[#On Reference Apps - Progressive Web Applications]], below).
- #app/Notepad is my favorite for instant text editing. I deal with a lot of text, using #app/Ditto as my Clipboard Manager (ðŸ‘ˆ #2ba-document? seems good to have - very helpful for taking notes is capturing what one captures into a history one can review at-will)
- The more I think on this project, the more I realize that I customize literally everything. I even have a Chrome extension that I use to inject JavaScript that makes changes to how things are displayed and/or adds extra features to pages I use daily.[^2]
  - It's nothing super fancy, but custom things tend to be time-consuming and tough to maintain, if poorly designed. All my JavaScript runs as gracefully as I can make it without dedicating more time to it. Errors aren't displayed, but are acknowledged to myself, the end-user. That is a project, however, that has company-internal references, so it won't be shared (and/or those parts would be omitted, perhaps some skeleton code to give an idea of what it does with the unshared, full, "live" version).
  - Most of what I mean by customizing everything is that I tinker *A LOT*, which is to say always, and at every reasonable opportunity (especially if I can say I'm learning something for what I do without feeling like I'm wasting time or just fooling around on company time[^3]).

Placing the above notes in my personal vault first really helped me stay focused on what I wanted to do for the day without necessarily diving too deeply into this project. This is a case (for me) where adding a step makes sense, and generally with #personal/health/ADHD, it is very effective to place barriers between one's productivity and things that are maybe too convenient. The day's goal for this entry was to assure the content was a little less "meta" and a lot more meaningful. 

 
[^2]: Changes are made via the HTML DOM (document object model), which is what you see on a web page, how you see it, and includes Electron apps like Obsidian! The extension wouldn't work with Obsidian, but Chromium's WebDev tools are available and very useful, typically.


## On Reference Apps - Progressive Web Applications

A category of applications that come in handy almost every day can be created individual to you. 

Specifically, if I use a web site as reference more or less daily (or at least a few times a month, say), I "install" that site as an Edge or Chromium "App". 

In Edge, you may click an ellipsis (...), click "Apps", and then click "Install this site as an app...". You should read the prompts that follow and answer your hearts desire and/or google unknown stuff (if needed). 

Apps installed from Edge or Chrome are called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) by Microsoft. Chrome has them as links, which operate very similarly.

My examples of what I use daily are:

- An App for Work Orders - An internal ticketing system is its own web app
- An App for Third-Party Customer Support Site - An external ticketing and documentation system for a software I support.
- An App for the AppWiki - An internal reference system to formalize technical documentation wiki-style.

Also, I have Edge as my default web app (so links open there), Edge Beta as the default for creating my PWAs (which is also where a PWA will open links if I hold the CTRL key while clicking the link). Then I have Chrome installed for sites that require it. Last, and perhaps most importantly, Mozilla Firefox is my "extention free" operational browser. It's my preferred browser server admin pages and for the third-party softwares where I'm able to offer help.

[^3]: There was a time when fooling around on company time was something I did. For example, social media, messaging, and any number of other personal things would gobble up company time years and years ago, before my present position. The primary reason for that happening was untreated ADHD. Perhaps that, and I also had a lot of growing up to do due to other mental health issues from earlier in my career. My case is one of "things can be bad, but you can get better, and trying and failing is worth it regardless of how you suceed (or not) in the end". That's not a quote of anyone but myself.
