# 2022-05-16 Mon

I wrote [[z header files explained]], which explains the [[z header]] file in more detail.

I also did [[#Linter Config]].

I wrote [[#Preparing for a Set of Actions]] as I made a teeny thing in my personal notes and wanted to capture it maybe a bit *ad nauseam*.

Referencing a header (sub-topic) you've created is (on the keyboard) `[[##`, and then a menu should come up.

## Preparing for a Set of Actions

#2ba-separate-doc maybe... 

Right now, I'm preparing for a task that will take between 45 minutes to an hour, give or take. 

In my personal daily note (not shown), I'm first creating a subheader. In this case, it's an H2 - on keyboard: `##` - to form a separate document inline. By default (or at least with Minimal theme), you may collapse headers, so designing within one makes sense. It might be similar to a layer in painting.

### Method

Reference material on one side (left), writing medium on the other side (right). For this laptop at 13.5" (abt 232.5 mm) diagonal, I've split the screen vertically for this task. [^1]

In this case, the reference material is a case/ticket (not shown), and I pull what details I need for my task from the case.

What I need to know are the numbered versions of some software modules, along with the order to address those versioned products on a server or two. 

Altogether, the preparation, which I finished about 10 minutes ago (or *whenever* before typing here) is one line of text with three steps and just over a dozen words. Without directly collating the words, I can't say, but about 100 words. (Incidentally, to collate data from a web page, I use #app/Chrome/DevTools from #app/MS-Edge.)

## Linter Config

#2ba-separate-doc A "linter" is something that typically makes code conform to standards. It fixes common (human-driven, mostly) editing mistakes. Following are the settings I use.

- On: Format Tags in YAML
- YAML Timestamp
  - On: "Keep track of the date..."
  - On: Date Created and Date Modified
  - On: Date Created/Modified Key is "`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ\\Z`"
- On: File Name Heading
- On: Proper Ellipsis
- On: Trailin spaces (both options On)
- On: Heading blank lines (both On - one option is defaulted to On)
- On: Compact YAML
- On: Consecutive blank lines (enforce only one consecutive blank line)
- On: Line Break at Document End (a proper Markdown thing so Visual Studio doesn't complain in the linter I use there)

[^1]: Meta: and also these notes are open, same screen. It's Windows 10, so I'm ALT+TAB-ing between app windows.
