I'm thinking about note-taking and reducing distractions. Generally, because I suffer from #personal/health/ADHD, I do tend to get easily distracted. There are some rules of thumb I follow to make my life a bit smoother, to remove distractions, and to keep things as simple as I can think to make them. 

First, and despite anything I or anyone else says, you should probably try to follow the science. That doesn't mean that every single, solitary study should grab your attention with dramatic, newsworthy&mdash;or allegedly so&mdash;findings. What it does mean is that one should practice evidence-based medicine, seeking medical care where needed. That's my way of saying that everyone is going to be different, especially when it comes to reducing distractions to account for or to help cope with issues that arise from neurodivergence (such as the inability to focus under the influence of immediate distractions).

My rules of thumb should be simple enough, and they are in the order I think of them:

- Animations should be reduced
	- For Windows 10, I don't have the Taskbar disappear when I'm in an app. Instead, if I need to focus only one one app, for instance; if I need that Taskbar to disappear, I hit F11 to go full screen. 
	- For OSX, I know the Dock has the option to stay or disappear. The last time I owned a Macbook was quite some time ago, so I can't say what I would do with that OS.
	- For Linux desktops, the desktop managers can be very limited or very custom in terms of configuration available. Less is typically the best for visual elements on screen if you have ADHD like mine.
	- For Android, if there were bubble or other animations, I typically disabled them. Some of this was accounting for really crappy phones, where reducing animations likewise would reduce CPU/GPU load and allow for a somewhat faster response in the UI.
		- For good Android phones like the Pixel I have for work, I've not had to adjust animations or anything like that.
	- For iOS, I haven't fiddled with animations. If something were excessive, I'd axe it, but I can't remember having the need to do so.
- For Taskbar or Dock or Launcher or Home, keep only the most-used apps
	- For me, the Taskbar is always displaying in Windows 10. I keep only 12 apps there, and each one is an app I use at least once a week or more. The first 5 apps are Explorer, Obsidian, Outlook (PWA), VS Code, and Windows Terminal. This is because of what I do for work, but I do recommend having your note-taking app front-and-center as much as possible.
- Desktop icons should be reduced
	- If you use your desktop to hold icons for things (links to web pages, apps, spreadsheets, docs, so forth), try to keep it to less than 1/2 of the desktop. 
- Prefer the use of a single laptop screen or a single desktop monitor
	- Increase visual space as needed (by changing resolution, font size, scale, and/or other settings&mdash;whatever is available to you), but try to stick with one monitor by having apps take up 1/2 of the screen when comparing and/or note-taking. For Windows 10 or 11, use a tool like PowerToys' Fancy Zones to divvy up screen space for using as many as three apps at the same time. The Canvas layout for Fanzy Zones is particularly useful in that regard.
	- Large screens 
		- Best for sharing in-person / on-site
		- Great, but not magically better when it comes to distractions
		- Having a larger screen offers more opportunity (in terms of pixels) for visual distraction. It's something to be aware of if you're as sensitive as I am.
		- For large screens, I prefer a movie format (so 1:2, 9:16, or other similar horizontal ratio), and I prefer to divide my screen into as many as 3 parts (and I prefer only having it divided once, vertically)
		- Try to have *at most* 3 apps displaying at the same time with the preference being only one app at a time, or two apps when comparing.
	- Dual or more monitors
		- Great since they can be configured to be vertically, horizontally, or however one wants
		- They can reduce distraction for comparing things (keeping from needing to switch apps or app windows on a single monitor)
		- They can add distraction if there are excessive widgets, too many apps, desktop icons, so forth 
- Use as many as two Virtual Desktops
	- With distraction reduction in mind, a virtual desktop should be "What I'm doing right now". Whenever I need to put something to the side that I should get back to very quickly&mdash;definitely the same day, I push it to a second virtual desktop. It's a rare thing. I've experimented with using Virtual Desktops more often, but didn't find them to have the utility I needed. By definition, adding another screen, virtual or not, adds a place where things could get lost and/or become a distraction by taking attention away from what your really want to know or do.
	- This Obsidian vault you're reading is in it's own Virtual Desktop
- Have repeating tasks that begin in the morning
- Have project tasks begin sooner than later 
	- Don't wait for tomorrow to accomplish what you can do today[^1]
	- This follows a story from Stephen R. Covey of filling a jar with rocks, sand, and water. To fit any of the big rocks in, you must place them first. So **the big rocks go first**. Big rocks can be stuff that needs to happen daily, even if it's small potatoes, but if a task is a project (will take more than 2 to 5 minutes to do based on #tech/Getting-Things-Done, it's a "project") one should consider it to be a "big rock" and try to get it done before smaller rocks and sand.
