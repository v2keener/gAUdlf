Now it's three weeks to presentation. My neglect of this project isn't necessarily intentional, but part of learning and creating things is defined by me as "flying a bit by the seat of my pants". The knowledge I have is real, and so is the experience, but mental illness doesn't always permit me to pay attention to what I want to when I would wish to do so. For me, this is related to #personal/health/ADHD. For others, it could be related to other conditions of #personal/health/Executive-Dysfunction, where one's prefrontal cortex isn't quite up to speed with the neurological average of humanity.

Philosophy and excuses aside, I'm really proud to work on this. I want to make it something special. Next week, I need to be rehearsing, so that means this week, the presentation needs the following to be done:

- Full presentation outline 
	- Any slides need to be created/ready
	- Redundancy should be built in - if the first plan for presentation isn't viable, I should have a backup plan 
		- i.e. if some media doesn't function, if there's a bug, or if some other show-stopper happens, it shouldn't be able to stop the show unless it's a matter of catastrophe (in which case the presentation may not matter much)
	- Further contingency planning:
		- Not enough time - have a subset of presentation 
		- Late arrivals, early arrivals, and other interruptions or distractions
- This 'public' vault organized 
	- ...or at least passably organized &mdash; enough for me to consider it "satisfactory"
