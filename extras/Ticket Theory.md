This is the same as [[Spoon Theory]] with the stipulation that some of us have so many "tickets" per day. We may not get a ticket to every ride we *could* ride on that day, but we may get some tickets, which expire. 

Typical or unaffected people (without a hampering condition or disability) get tickets they can use for whatever. The get the equivalent of being able to go to the front of the line. Those of us with executive dysfunction[^1] don't necessarily get to consciously control what we get to do in a day. There are time constraints and being time blind (in my case) makes things that much tougher.

[^1]: Executive Dysfunction (EF) of which, #personal/health/ADHD is almost certainly an indicator.
