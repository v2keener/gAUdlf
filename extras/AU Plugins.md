# Golden Obsidian Plugins

These are the plugins currently included as Git submodules under `.obsidian/plugins/`, and a short reason for why they're included.

## Installs

These are the plugins I like.

### AU Recommended Pluggins

The recommendation is that I like them. Your mileage may vary.

![[Obsidian Default Core Plugins#AU Community Plugins]]

### How I made the AU Plugins and Obsidian Default Core Plugins docs

- Open the referenced doc + header in separate text editor (CTRL+P, then "Open in default app", then your operating system should present you with option(s))
- With [[Obsidian Default Core Plugins]] opened in my text editor. ...And this document, itself (separate tab in VSCode).
- Opening Obsidian Settings for this vault
  - In VSCode, I have split panes, just like I'd do in Obsidian (but I'm in Obsidian doing Settings, ergo, this).
- ==Click "Community plugins" toggle / slider==
- ==Read the "Safe mode" warning and agreement, then agree to it if you want to install what follows.==
- ==So, if you agree to the risks of turning off "Safe mode", agree.==
- With Safe mode off, options under "Safe mode" appear in Settings
- Click "Browse" button
- And now I'll begin typing the names of the plugins I have in the other doc into the "Search community plugins" field (top left).
- For each plugin, I click the plugin name, left pane, then click "Install" on the right pane. 
  - If I wish, I may click "Enable" as well, after Install is complete
  - Installs are usually very quick

## Honorable Mentions
  - Cycle through Panes is for a Most-Recently Used, known as an MRU, order of cycling through open document panes when hitting CTRL+TAB to switch panes. It's a preference I try to keep everywhere.
- Editor Syntax Highlight isn't going to be useful for someone who doesn't use the &grave; `code` tildes / backticks.
- #edit File path to URI in conjunction with #app/ShareX (clipper)
- Without adding more notes from number 7, onward, I have a lot more footwork to cover reasons, if I want to, for which things I install #edit
