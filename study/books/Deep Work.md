Great book. I'm not sure if I've read all of it. If I did, that explains why all of it seems so *de ja vous* when I'm reading the parts I know I definitely read. 

Vanity aside, I remember of *Deep Work* that it espouses being involved in work to enrich others and oneself as much as possible. It involved some unplugging from social media, and a different mindset, but I can't remember details without rereading the book. 

I do know Cal Newport's ideas changed my life with whatever I've read of the book. My social media exposure is significant, but I don't add to it every day like I used to. This (what you're reading) kind of thing is more worthwhile. The idea of people reading it and hopefully finding value and enjoyment in what I write tickles my brain.
