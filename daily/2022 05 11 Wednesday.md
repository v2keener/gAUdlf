# 2022 05 11 Wednesday

I didn't forget about this project yesterday, but I was mindful of it, I think.

Things I might wish to do with this project today: 

- Set up daily notes
- Set up templater, add templates w/README (maybe make that a submodule - it's getting busy in my personal vault)
- Wanna read "Building a Second Brain" (Tiago Forte)? 
	- Current thought is that this is organic-only project. For me, the point of #app/Obsidian is that one can customize as one goes. The principles I'm using are those based on Cal Newport's "[[Deep Work]]" and David Allen's "[[Getting Things Done]]". 

## Actual

"Actual" is my heading for things I'm actually doing, real-time, if I'm able or feel the need to capture them.

- I wrote the [[Deep Work]] page, above in a minute or two.
- I also wrote the [[Getting Things Done]] page in more than a minute or two, since I (think I) remembered more details.

#2ba-footnote  This "Actual" heading is an H2. I try to conform to some Markdown standard #app/VSCode has where you only should have one H1 per page/document.
