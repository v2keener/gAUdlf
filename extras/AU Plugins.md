# Golden Obsidian Plugins

These are the plugins currently included as Git submodules under `.obsidian/plugins/`, and a short reason for why they're included.

## Installs

These are the plugins I like.

### AU Recommended Pluggins

The recommendation is that I like them. Some of these plugins go really well together, like Checklist and Reminder(s), then there's Advanced Tables and Markdown Table Editor. Your mileage may vary on what's useful or how it works for you, and that's good.

### How I made the AU Plugins and Obsidian Default Core Plugins docs

- Open the referenced doc + header in separate text editor (CTRL+P, then "Open in default app", then your operating system should present you with option(s))
- With [[Obsidian Default Core Plugins]] opened in my text editor. ...And this document, itself (separate tab in VSCode).
- Opening Obsidian Settings for this vault
  - In VSCode, I have split panes, just like I'd do in Obsidian (but I'm in Obsidian doing Settings, ergo, this).
- ==Click "Community plugins" toggle / slider==
- ==Read the "Safe mode" warning and agreement, then agree to it if you want to install what follows.==
- ==So, if you agree to the risks of turning off "Safe mode", agree.==
- With Safe mode off, options under "Safe mode" appear in Settings
- Click "Browse" button
- And now I'll begin typing the names of the plugins I have in the other doc into the "Search community plugins" field (top left).
- For each plugin, I click the plugin name, left pane, then click "Install" on the right pane. 
  - If I wish, I may click "Enable" as well, after Install is complete
  - Installs are usually very quick
