Less than 10 days are left, I believe. That is just fine. 

I am off-schedule. That is not 100% "just fine", but it is OK. Indeed, being off-schedule is somewhat nominal for most people with #personal/health/ADHD. 

It has been rather difficult to work on this project and to express some of the broad goals I've had written, and perhaps not achieved. Then again, I know there are goals I've achieved and not recorded (here). 

Currently, I'm creating the content for the content I'll present at WVSTC 2022 in my personal notes. Here, I'm creating comments on the creation of content for the content of which, this is part (of the content). My brain isn't *not* odd.

The slides are easy enough to capture. For capturing parts of an application on my desktop, I use ShareX, which is open-sourced and free to use. It's also useful for annotating captures. I'll take that and make slides (which are way less moving parts than a demo).
