# The Expanse

This is a series of 9 books, plus novellas and short stories. It's a space saga and I really dig it. If I want to write more about it, here's the place to put my notes.

Currently, I'm rereading the series.

## Book I

The foreshadowing was all there the whole time. Reading through the first few chapters again (or maybe dozen&mdash;it's easy to lose count), I'm impressed with how the story is told and I love the first-person, third-person narrator perspective.
