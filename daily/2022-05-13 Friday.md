# 2022-05-13 Fri

At first, I had some trouble getting Templater to render the template I created for these daily notes.

## Actual

- Trying to open this every morning. Going to give it a different theme so I don't take my personal daily note content here.
- How this page spawned ( #app/Obsidian/plugin Template, a core plugin, isn't enabled):
```markdown
<% tp.file.include("[[z daily_header]]") %>

# <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD ddd")  %>

notes_here
```
- Enabled Templates core plugin, then disabled it because,
- Enabled setting in Templater: "Trigger Templater on new file creation". There's a warning to this in Obsidian Settings, so make sure to read it.
- Changed #app/Obsidian/theme to "Things" theme by Colin Eckert. This looks different enough to stand out from Moonstone (default Obsidian theme as of today).
- It's a little later and I'm in the middle of an install, so I have a moment. Beginning [[Obsidian -Home]].
- I also made [[Books - Home]].
