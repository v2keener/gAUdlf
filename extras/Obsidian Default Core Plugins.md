## Honorable Mentions

Plugins I don't currently have enabled:

- Admonition
- Advanced URI
- Day Planner
- Gist
- Jump to link
- Review
- Smart Random Note
- Status Bar Pomodoro Timer

[^1]: Checklist is really useful with the Reminder plugin.

[^2]: This one is a special case. I don't have it installed, but until I learned the keyboard shortcuts I use for UX operations, day-to-day, I kept Key Promoter active. It's really a great plugin and especially great for keyboard and touch-type folks.

[^3]: Style Settings seems mostly useful with themes that support it. I have CSS from somewhere I'll need to put the link here. #edit/add-link
