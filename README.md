# Obsidian AU Vault

*(THIS IS DRAFT MATERIAL - the Conference is in mid July 2022, so I'm preparing this "live")*

An Obsidian "vault" is a folder or directory[^ish] on a computer.

This vault is intended as a public Github repo for bonus content related to the West Virginia State Technology Conference 2022 presentation on "Note-taking in Obsidian"[^1]. This is part of forming and shaping what will be presented.

The conference presentation should at least help people *feel* more organized, especially for those more organized that I could reasonably expect to be, but my hope is that those introduced to this note-taking++[^plusplusplusplus] app try it out and enjoy it.

## A Golden Vault 
..."Golden Vault" [^abc]

This Github repository is intended as a "golden" Obsidian vault. One can use this or the 'template' version of this vault to have some pre-made things I find handy in my primary, private vault for note-taking. ( #2ba-footnote The [template vault](https://github.com/v2keener/gAUdlf-template) should be populated by the end of June 2022.)

For instance, I've chosen some plugins I find handy to incorporate as submodules. I've also included the `.obsidian` folder, which has the `*.json` files, CSS, and other support files.

## Why gAUdlf...

"gAUdlf" means:
- 'g' for "Gustavo"
- 'AU' as the elemental symbol for "gold"
- 'dlf' for my last name, "DeLaFuerza", which is Spanish for 'of the force'

[^ish]: So I say a "directory" and "folder" are synonyms, but it really depends on context. For the most part, unless you're in IT, you're dealing with "folders", which IT folks might call "directories". And other people. Who's to say? The point is that the two words both are and are not synonyms and this tracks with the M.O of a lot of technical stuff where irony is not only implied but explicitely defined in excruciating detail, but maybe entertainingly.

[^1]: "Note-taking in Obsidian" was presented on behalf of West Virginia Network (WVNET), the company that hosted the conference. Gustavo Keener, a Banner DBA for WVNET, is the author of this content.

[^abc]: My thought 7 days after writing "Golden Vault" is that such 'branding' might be a bit grandiose. The "might" is funny, because it's definitely grandiose.

[^plusplusplus]: "Note-taking++" (note-taking plus plus) because like "C++" it's an advancement on note-taking that adds a lot of things considered by many people to be missing in most other apps.
