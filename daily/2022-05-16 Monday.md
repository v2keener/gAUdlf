# 2022-05-16 Mon

I wrote [[z header files explained]], which explains the [[z header]] file in more detail.

## Linter Config

#2ba-separate-doc A "linter" is something that typically makes code conform to standards. It fixes common (human-driven, mostly) editing mistakes. Following are the settings I use.

- On: Format Tags in YAML
- YAML Timestamp
  - On: "Keep track of the date..."
  - On: Date Created and Date Modified
  - On: Date Created/Modified Key is "`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ\\Z`"
- On: File Name Heading
- On: Proper Ellipsis
- On: Trailin spaces (both options On)
- On: Heading blank lines (both On - one option is defaulted to On)
- On: Compact YAML
- On: Consecutive blank lines (enforce only one consecutive blank line)
- On: Line Break at Document End (a proper Markdown thing so Visual Studio doesn't complain in the linter I use there)
