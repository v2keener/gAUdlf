During the workday, I'm thinking I'll review these notes again.

Looking at the Graph view, I'll need to get these daily notes linked (as I prefer to do with my personal vault). 

I took about 15 minutes to link all these Daily Notes together.

...And I feel like I just learned how to use the Graph view. That was much easier than I thought. It came down to selecting a path and changing the force parameters (link parameters being particularly effective to identify linear relationships between daily notes, for instance).
