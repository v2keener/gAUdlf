# Getting Things Done

I enjoyed the book by David Allen.

General disclaimer: This is from my memory only. Please correct me where I'm wrong.

Going from memory, and telling you how I use the system *Getting Things Done* 4-ME[^1] is to:
- Have an Inbox
	- this can be various places you collect things to do with modern smartphone apps, cross-device documentation, and instant online collaboration being common nowadays. Mr. Allen kind of makes it a point that his and others' methods grow from principles and one way may not be right for everyone. One's #tech/Getting-Things-Done/Inbox should form over time.
- Process quick items that you can do in 2 minutes or less, first.
	- For me, the rest stays in my Inbox (not a GTD best practice, btw) as "Projects" in GTD parlance. 
	- In practice, I put things I need to do later for my actual email Inbox into "Snooze", that way I can have a clear Inbox, for the moment.
- As much as possible, have a clear Inbox, and go through Projects every day you go through your Inbox.
- Other things I don't remember

Projects are things that will take more than a brief moment or two to handle, like "Organize a meeting with A, B, C," as people are commonly named[^2] might be considered a Project.

[^2]: Joke. Needing a footnote to label a joke is probably an indication of a poor- or extended context / inside-joke.
