# Keyboard Shortcuts - Home

If a shortcut is in italics, it means it overrides a default Obsidian setting. All of these settings are in `$vault_root/.obsidian/hotkeys.json`.

| Shortcut       | Purpose                    |
|:-------------- |:-------------------------- |
| CTRL+SHIFT+L   | Show/Hide left sidebar     |
| CTRL+SHIFT+R   | Show/Hide right sidebar    |
| *CTRL+SHIFT+P* | Show Command pallette [^1] |
| CTRL+SHIFT+H   | Highlight text             |
| ALT+M          | Move file                  |
| CTRL+SHIFT+O   | Open Daily Note for today  |
|                |                            |

[^1]: The default shortcut to show the Command pallette is CTRL+P. I use #app/VSCode  (Visual Studio Code) as primary text file editor mostly for programming languages, but also to edit Markdown files from Obsdian on occassion. It's always good to know how to take notes without Obsidian, and a text editor is enough for most daily notes.
