## Honorable Mentions

Plugins I don't currently have enabled. Some are not enabled simply because I haven't had time to look closely at what they do, and some because maybe I didn't find them as useful as I thought. They're still installed in my #personal/vault.

- Admonition
- Advanced URI
- Day Planner
- Gist
- Jump to link
- Review
- Smart Random Note
- Status Bar Pomodoro Timer
- Text Expander

[^1]: Checklist is really useful with the Reminder plugin.

[^2]: This one is a special case. I don't have it installed, but until I learned the keyboard shortcuts I use for UX operations, day-to-day, I kept Key Promoter active. It's really a great plugin and especially great for keyboard and touch-type folks.

[^3]: Style Settings seems mostly useful with themes that support it. I have CSS from somewhere I'll need to put the link here. #edit/add-link

[^4]: Vimrc Support is really for those who know what a `.vimrc` or other #app/Vim startup file are and what they do %%(I have a really small one I want to remember to share #edit/share ). I'm adding tags presuming I'll get back to this soon&dash;at least every other day%%
