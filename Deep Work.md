Great book. I'm not sure if I've read all of it. If I did, that explains why all of it seems so *de ja vous* when I'm reading the parts I know I definitely read. 

Vanity aside, I remember of *Deep Work*, that it espouses being involved in work to enrich others and oneself as much as possible. It involved some unplugging from social media, and a different mindset, but I can't remember details without rereading the book.
