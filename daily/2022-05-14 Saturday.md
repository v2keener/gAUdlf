What I've done is pulled from #app/Git on my personal laptop, and I'm working from that, presently.

And the Daily Note worked! Also, the theme is here and everything. 

All of what I build here involves me typing very quickly (about six dozen words a minute). Does it seem useful? Is it building towards presenting "Taking notes in Obsidian"? 

## ADHD and Note-taking

My perspective is that none of building a personal knowledge base or taking notes is too easy. In some regards, I'm fortunate that I have no choice. It's either "take notes" or "forget it all". There isn't much in between that. 

Due to #personal/health/ADHD and a 1%-percentile working memory (I wish I were kidding), if I don't write a thing down, I don't know that thing. The exception would be if and only if my brain is so "spongey" towards a topic that I can't help but remember it. That exception applies to science videos, listening to music, and a lot of other things that don't come to memory right now.

## Actual

- I wrote everything else in this doc before writing this part.
- Did some file organization
- Commented on the purpose of some of the docs I just reviewed, including [[Obsidian Default Core Plugins]], [[AU Plugins]], and most, if not all of the "Home" pages I use for organization[^asdf].

## Using simple, no-emoji folders

Something I'll be using for this project will be what I do to organize my personal vault. My first thought is that: I love emojis, but I don't want those in folder names, because then when I want to tell Obsidian where to place a document by declaring it's location and filename, e.g. `[[extras/Something I thought about]]`, while I'm writing, it's easier (for me) to do that without emojis being in the path. 

## Where emojis work for me

For categorization and immediate visual identification of certain things, emojis make so much sense 🎉.  Here, I'll list what I use for the Obsidian Reminders plugin:

- 🏡 - household tasks/items
- 💰 - Monet - just kidding: money
- 💻 - computer-related stuff 
- ⚖️ - anything legal or legal-related
- 🎯 - review of other tasks, usually
- 📞 - phone call
- 🔌- personal sysadmin stuff (e.g. " 🔌 fix up WiFi for security  reasons")
- ⚒️ - career stuff (e.g. update profile X, update resume, that kind of thing)
- 🔂 - repeating task that (where I want to see in the Reminder text that something is happening often[^1])

[^1]: My only example of a repeating thing with the 🔂 emoji is my "Email triage" reminder, which I do daily. I only do it for the work email account associated with earning money to make a living. I'm trying to get into the habit for my personal email accounts, too: Check, skim, triage into archive, flag for action, and/or leave in Inbox.

[^asdf]: In regards to Home pages, something useful one can do with them is to form a Dashboard.
